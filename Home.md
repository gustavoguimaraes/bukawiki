Potlucks, frisbee, etc on the Acora lawn in front of Oppelner Straße
Hertz car rental on Bonnheimer Straße. Allows you to drop off on Sundays, but be sure to take photos of the car before you drop it off to ensure liability

IFS Language School
IFS may organize the occasional day trip or activity for BuKas. 
IFS frequently runs out of soap for the bathrooms, so bring hand sanitizer.
Note that the IFS school was “cleansed” with fire by a student conducting a traditional  purification ritual so you may be at a different location that we were.
Lunch Options near IFS  

Deutsche Post Tower cafeteria
You’ll need to get a chip card at the automat first (costs about 5 Euros).  After purchasing the card (5 Euros is Pfand), you’ll need to put money on the card.  You go through the lines and pick out which food you want, and at the cash register, they take the money off of the card.  
Deutsche Welle - better than the Post Tower, but more expensive (they charge a euro or two extra for non-DW employees)
Consider packing your lunch for variety
Ice Cream. 
There was always an ice cream truck on the corner between IFS and the Post Tower as well.  Ice cream was about 1 Euro per scoop and perfect on hot days!

You can hike to several different destinations (Drachenfels, Schloss Drachenburg, the Milchhaüschen, etc. or just wander through plenty of trails)
Google maps displays most of the larger trails
Look at all the stops on the free boat tour & check them out!
Drachenfels (hiking up is more fun!) - this is in Siebengebirge
Hike to Milchhaüschen Restaurant near Drachenfels - this is in Siebengebirge
Schloss Drachenburg- this is in Siebengebirge
Brühler Schloss (has concerts too!)
Traumpfade Hiking trails! http://www.traumpfade.info/home

Mosel Wine Region is really worth visiting!

Weekend Trips
Weekend trips highly recommended!  Get out and explore Europe a little, and get to know different cultures while you have this time to get settled in.  The BahnCard 25 or BahnCard 50 make traveling cheaper when you used the Deutsche Bahn system to get around.  Germany (and Europe in general) are very well-connected when it comes to transportation.  Enjoy!  
Burg Eltz (hike in Eifel Region), can be combined with a drive across the border to Maastricht
Strasbourg
Luxembourg
Amsterdam
Paris
Stockholm
Mosel River Valley
Brussels
It’s nice and close to Bonn, but remember that you will also be visiting during your Studienreise in March.  Some people still like to go and get the touristy stuff done though, as you won’t have a ton of time to do this during the Studienreise
Buy a Bike!
Save money on the local train! Go to places you can’t go by public transport! Have some liberty! Ride to language school next to the Rhine! Bicycles can be transported by bus at the end of the language seminar to Berlin.

Internet & Cell Phones
The Acora offers internet during your stay in the form of daily internet vouchers.  Many of us were frustrated by the speed of the internet, as well as the limited data which the internet allows for upload/download.  As such, some of us sought out the various internet cafe options in the neighborhood and in the city.  You’ll notice that Europe does not have as much free WiFi as the US does, so be sure to plan ahead!  
Internet Cafés
Goldbraun an der Uni - Am Hof 26A, Bonn
Giaccomo - Bottlerplatz 10, 53111 Bonn 
Bagel Brothers - Maximilianstraße 14, 53111 Bonn
Starbucks - generally offers free WiFi, 2 in city center
Bonngout
Italian restaurant in Bad Godesberg center near main station

Internet Speed Sticks
If you are tired of heading towards internet cafes and sick of the slow Acora internet, you might want to consider investing in an O2 speed stick.  The stick costs approximately 30€, which includes the set-up costs.  
Each month, to get internet which is good enough for Skyping, it costs approximately 25-35€ per month.  It is a limited internet, but it is a good supplement, especially if you are planning on traveling a lot for your project later
Cell Phones
Lebara offers affordable plans, English-speaking customer service, and will mail you a free SIM card if you sign up online. Plans are flexible, so consider whether you will make calls and send texts mostly to US or Germany, and how much data you want.
BuKas used a range of carriers - consider Congstar and 02.

Sports & Exercise
Soccer fields & Basketball Courts 
There are some very near the Acora. From the reception, take a right into the street, a left at the cul-de-sac, under the bridge, and the soccer fields are on your right. Basketball courts just down the way on the left. Try to go during non-peak hours since some local teams practice there.
Swimming
Romerbad is a great outdoor swimming pool with many different pools and an artificial wave simulator that can be reached by bike or bus, and you can use a coupon from the Anmeldung!
Gyms
McFit near IFS 
2 locations in Bonn and also throughout Germany
You can join and cancel if you show that you are leaving Bonn, or this gym also exists in other cities as well. Some people were able to terminate the contract with a letter from IFS indicating they were a student and that their course was completed, thus were no longer going to be in Bonn.  
McFit near IFS gets crowded around 8 am and around 4 to 5 pm.  
This gym is cheap (20 euros/month) but you need to have your bank account set up in Germany, and you need to accept a contract for 1 year.  
Sportmeile near Acora
On your way to the soccer fields
You can get a 10-time pass, so no need to sign a contract
Classes, ladies fitness area
Indoor badminton courts
Other
Haribo badminton courts (paid)

#Other Practical Things
##Haircuts
  +Salvatore near Brauhaus Bönnsch (Wolf is great for women’s haircuts)
  +There’s a pretty cheap decent place in the mall with the Hit Markt


##Printing documents
*  The Hotel Acora will print train tickets & small things at the reception; you can also try the internet cafe right near the stairs at the T-Busch train stop.
##Groceries
*  HIT (they have everything!), Aldi & DM behind Acora for food & drugstores; Large BioMarkt by Hauptbahnhof; Galeria Kaufhof for fancy import foods
##Laundry
*  Washing your clothes at The Acora can be expensive. The front desk charges by the hour. One Buka bought an 11€ drying rack at HIT and hand-washed everything in the shower. Dry Cleaner at Tannenbusch Mitte is excellent. Friendly, quick with cleaning, and does a good job. She will also do bulk laundry.
